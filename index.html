        <h2>Wuhan: from lockdown to the new normal </h2>
        <p class = "quote">
          China first alerted the World Health Organization to 27 cases of “viral pneumonia” in Wuhan
           on 31 December 2019. Now, almost a year on, life appears to be returning to normal with few
            indications of the city’s early role in the pandemic, which has infected more than 67 
            million people globally. Wuhan has not recorded a new locally transmitted case in several 
            months and is now indistinguishable from many other Chinese cities. While business has yet 
            to return fully to normal, shoppers have returned to Wuhan’s streets.</p>

       <p> Rich countries are hoarding doses of Covid vaccines and people living in poor
          countries are set to miss out, a coalition of campaigning bodies warns.The People's Vaccine 
          Alliance says nearly 70 lower-income countries will only be able to vaccinate one 
          in 10 people. This is despite Oxford-AstraZeneca pledging to provide 64% of its doses to 
          people in developing nations.  Steps are being taken to ensure access to vaccines is fair
          around the globe.</p>

        <h2>Oxford/AstraZeneca Covid vaccine 'safe and effective'</h2>

         <p> The Oxford/AstraZeneca Covid vaccine is safe and effective, giving good
          protection, researchers have confirmed. Most in the study were younger than 55, but the 
          results so far indicate it does work well in older people too. The peer-reviewed data in
          The Lancet journal also suggests the vaccine can reduce the spread of Covid, as well protect 
          against illness and death.</p>

          <h2>Covid: UK isolation period shortened to 10 days</h2>
          <p>The change will also apply to people instructed to quarantine after 
            returning from high-risk countries.And it means anyone who has been self-isolating for 
            10 days or more will be able to end their quarantine on Monday. The announcement comes 
            as data shows Covid cases falling in most of England and Northern Ireland. But the Office
            for National Statistics (ONS) figures show that in the week to 5 December, there were 
            increases in coronavirus case numbers in London and the east of England. On Thursday,
            Health Secretary Matt Hancock announced mass testing would be rolled out for secondary
            school children, their families and teachers in the worst-affected areas of London, Kent
            and Essex. The change in self-isolation rules was announced in a statement from the four 
            UK chief medical officers (CMOs) said: "After reviewing the evidence, we are now confident 
            that we can reduce the number of days that contacts self-isolate from 14 days to 10."People
            who return from countries which are not on the travel corridor list should also self-isolate for 10 days instead of 14 days.".</p>
