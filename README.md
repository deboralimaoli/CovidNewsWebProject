This project was developed for an assessment in the BootCamp of Gama Academy.
The aim of the project is to create a website in HTML and CSS for Covid News. 
The Website has to contain four pages: home, about, contact and Learn more About it. 
The contact form and the about the team was developed based in code on W3School with some alterations made by me.
